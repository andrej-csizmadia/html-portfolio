<h1>Andy's all time favorite movies</h1>
<h2>My top 5 favorite movies of the current time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h3>
<p>I really like the VFX here and the way they have portayed the Death Eaters and the Aurors. 4/5 rating due to few missing rooms at the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>Probably my favorite anime movie of all times. I appreciate the emotional showcase of the characters and the importance of the family bond, paying for your decisions and character growth.</p>
<h3>Scream franchise</h3>
<p>Who doesn't like scary movies with a good pacing and Courteney Cox in it? The last 2 entries were pretty amazing, however, the 1st one that set things in motion will always stand as the best one.</p>
<h3>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</h3>
<p>Any swifties over here? My go to movie to make my day better and to clean the house. Unfortunately, I have never finished the cleaning due to performances I did.</p>
<h3>The Holiday</h3>
<p>My go-to Christmas Movie. Also, Jude Law is such a hottie there. Cameron Diaz as well!</p>
